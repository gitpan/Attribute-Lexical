version 0.002; 2010-04-11

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    passing package through to required code in pure-Perl version of
    Lexical::SealRequireHints)

  * make all numeric comparisons against $] stringify it first, to avoid
    architecture-dependent problems with floating point rounding giving
    it an unexpected numeric value

  * change Attribute::Lexical::UNIVERSAL POD filename from a .pm to the
    .pod that it should have been

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.001; 2009-10-21

  * use Lexical::SealRequireHints in place of the filename-based
    workaround for %^H leakage, thus allowing lexical attribute
    definitions to propagate into string evals, on Perl versions that
    allow it

  * document Attribute::Lexical::UNIVERSAL in its own POD file

  * declare version of Attribute::Lexical::UNIVERSAL in a way that
    indexers are more likely to parse successfully

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * change perl version declared in build_requires to match that declared
    in requires, to avoid confusing tools that can only handle a single
    dependency list

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

version 0.000; 2009-08-24

  * initial released version
