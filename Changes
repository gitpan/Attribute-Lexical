version 0.001; 2009-10-21

  * use Lexical::SealRequireHints in place of the filename-based
    workaround for %^H leakage, thus allowing lexical attribute
    definitions to propagate into string evals, on Perl versions that
    allow it

  * document Attribute::Lexical::UNIVERSAL in its own POD file

  * declare version of Attribute::Lexical::UNIVERSAL in a way that
    indexers are more likely to parse successfully

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * change perl version declared in build_requires to match that declared
    in requires, to avoid confusing tools that can only handle a single
    dependency list

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

version 0.000; 2009-08-24

  * initial released version
